5-31-2018  This is a DSP toolbox project I coded for the NXP (Freescale) MCF52259 Coldfire microcontroller.  I used C for this project.
I also used the EZearth LCD for this project.  All the required drivers are written to communicate between these two devices.  I also coded
the required drivers for displaying signals on the screen.

The main idea for this project is to design a DSP filter using LabVIEW and upload the coefficients to the microcontroller.  The
microcontroller will then take these coefficients and convolute them with the captured raw signal.  Essentially, we can revise our filter
using LabVIEW and upload it to the microcontroller and see the response.  It is a flexible solution to adjust the filter to any signal
that we are working with.  So far, I have only used a signal from a signal generator.  However, I can forsee that any signal
from an antenae would do.

As of today, the device can do an FIR Low and Band pass filter.  The signal frequency is limited to below 20 kHZ.  There is no anti alias
filter at the front end.  This will cause aliasing at higher frequency.  This project has all the infrastructure codes ready.  More codes 
can be added to make the application more robust.  For example, we can add highpass and nopass filters.  We can also start our work with
multirate sampling DSP work.  The uniqueness about this project is that we can design and redesign our DSP filters and see an 
immidiate response.  We can then adjust our design for a closer solution.

I used CodeWarrior 7 to code the project.  I also used LabVIEW 7 to design the filter design.  I have uploaded all the required codes here.
There are pictures showing the hardware.
